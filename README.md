This a small chunk of code used for the interactive part of the
[Tracing on the shoulders of giants](http://slides.com/nietaki/tracing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants)
presentation. It's meant to be running some code in a loop in the background
so that you can try out the `Rexbug` or `redbug` tracing debugger.
